I have a big family. I have a mother, a father, a sister, and a grandmother. My mother is young and beautiful. Her name is Elena Petrovna. My father is young, too. His name is Oleg Ivanovich. My sister is four and she doesn’t go to school yet. My grandmother’s name is Olga Semenovna, she is very kind. I love my family very much.
